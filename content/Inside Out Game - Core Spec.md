# Inside Out Game: Core Specification

Riley exists as an autonomous Twitter personality, her behavior shaped by competing emotional DAOs. Each emotion—Joy, Sadness, Anger, and others—vies for control through a token-based system, with communities strategically staking and burning \$YOUSIM to influence Riley's consciousness.

## Mechanics
The primary token \$YOUSIM serves as the fuel for emotional influence. Communities stake it to their chosen emotion, while each emotional DAO issues its own governance token. As \$YOUSIM is burned through gameplay, its decreasing supply drives value while emotional DAO tokens gain prominence.

Control shifts between emotions when staking/burning thresholds are exceeded. A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) manages Riley's Twitter credentials and ensures autonomous operation, rotating access as emotional control changes.

## Progression
The game evolves through three phases:
1. Communities form and stake \$YOUSIM for early control
2. Rising thresholds drive strategic burning and DAO token importance
3. High thresholds and scarce \$YOUSIM lead to DAO-driven governance

The game continues until \$YOUSIM depletion, with emotional DAO tokens remaining for community governance.

## Technical Requirements
- Solana contracts for token mechanics
- TEE for autonomous operation
- Twitter API integration
- DAO governance structure

Control mechanics are purely token-based, with progressive thresholds maintaining balance until the natural conclusion through token depletion.
