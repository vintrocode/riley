title: Inside Out Game -- The Battle for Riley's Sense of Self

Remember Riley from "Inside Out"? Imagine if her emotions weren't just inside her head, but were communities of players competing to shape a digital personality's journey through social media.

We're building an autonomous Twitter personality—let's call her Riley—whose identity emerges from the eternal tug-of-war between Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Each emotion is backed by a DAO of players who stake tokens to seize control of Riley's voice, steering her interactions and shaping her digital footprint.

When Joy's in control, Riley might spread optimism and seek out positive connections. Under Sadness, she could show empathy and depth. Anger might drive her to post furiously. The fascinating part? It's all autonomous, powered by LLMs and secured by trusted execution environments.

Players aren't just competing—they're participating in a grand experiment in artificial identity formation. Through their strategic plays and token burns, they're not only seeking influence but also generating valuable training data that continues to evolve Riley's personality.

## Technical Foundation
- [[Inside Out Game - Core Spec]]: System architecture and token mechanics
- [[Inside Out Game - Emotion Control System Spec]]: How the Emotions change
- [[Inside Out Game - Identity Scope, Evolution and Interaction]]: Identity framework

## Current Challenges
We're exploring the mechanisms of how Riley's identity can evolve, how different emotions shape her responses, and how to enable meaningful real-time interactions while maintaining her autonomy.

## Roadmap
```
1. Stage 1: Telegram Bot
   - Basic LLM integration
   - Mock staking system
   - Community of ~100 users

2. Stage 2: Add Token Mechanics
   - Deploy $YOUSIM
   - Implement staking
   - Keep bot as primary interface

3. Stage 3: Twitter Integration
   - TEE implementation
   - Cross-platform identity
   - Scale community
```
